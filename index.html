                    <h2>Music Career</h2>
                    <p>In 2015 Lil Uzi Vert would get a record deal with Alantic Records under DJ Drama a older hip hop legend known for his mixing and crazy rants. This record deal would be mostly off the succes of Lil Uzi Verts album "Luv is Rage" resulting in alot of pressure being dropped of onto the singers shoulders. No one would expect their next move jumping out of the underground scene to the mainstream stage with their hit record "Money Longer". This single tape would solidfy Uzi as a true artist and not just an average mumble rapper, that same year Uzi would drop two more mixtapes with one being in collaboration with Alanta's very own santa Gucci Mane. In 2017 Uzi would be featured on the Migos hit song "Bad and Boujee" which would give the coming up artist more spotlight right as they had something big under their sleeve. In the same year the summer brought many classic songs but none stood a chance to Uzi "XO Tour Llif3" produced by TM88 another great friend of Uzi. This single song would put Uzi on the radar of some of the biggest names in hip hop, such as Pharrel Williams, Virgil Alboh, Kanye West, Young Thug, and Future; these names would continue to help build a path for Uzi. 2018 would be quiet for Uzi as they wouldnt release any new projects that year, but would still be nominated at the 2018 Grammys for "Best New Artist" for their second studio album. 2020 would be a crazy year of anticpation from many artist all saying that they would release new music, Uzi being one of them had been talking about their Album Eternal Atake. When it did drop it came out first on the billboard hot 100, as it was one of the most anticpated albums of 2020. Plenty of singles and great features would take place over the next few years as Uzi would tease a new project called "Pink Tape" which wouldnt release till June 30th 2023. Upon the success of their single "Just Wanna Rock" Uzi would finally bless their fans with "Pink Tape" after a few years of teasing the project. Whats to say what Lil Uzi Uzi will do in the future, all we know is they will continue to be a fashion icon for sure be rocking out. </p>
